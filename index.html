<h1>Cloning Survey Research Project</h1>

<div class="section" style="animation-delay: .2s;">
 <h2>Summary of the Study</h2>
 <p>This project surveyed students on their perceptions of cloning, animal ethics, and the accuracy with which they can identify cloned vs. non-cloned animals. Participants viewed four animals — a pig, a sheep, a gaur (often misread as "naur"), and a dog — two of which were cloned (sheep & gaur) and two of which were normal (pig & dog). After observing the images, participants responded to questions about animal cloning ethics, human cloning expansion, and the status of each animal. The goal of this survey was to explore public understanding, misconceptions, and moral perspectives regarding cloning.</p>
</div>

<!-- Question 1 -->
<div class="section">
 <h2>Should Animals Be Cloned?</h2>
 <canvas id="cloneChart"></canvas>
 <h3>Analysis</h3>
 <p>The updated survey results (Yes: 12, No: 7, Maybe: 9, Unopposed: 4) show a community divided on cloning but leaning slightly positive. The high number of "Maybe" responses suggests uncertainty and lack of public knowledge about cloning technology.</p>
</div>

<!-- Question 2 -->
<div class="section">
 <h2>Is Cloning Animals Humane?</h2>
 <canvas id="humaneChart"></canvas>
 <h3>Analysis</h3>
 <p>With 21 voting that cloning is humane and 11 saying it is not, opinions lean toward acceptance. However, about one-third remain concerned, highlighting perceived ethical risks.</p>
</div>

<!-- Individual Animal Charts -->
<div class="section">
 <h2>Pig — Normal or Cloned?</h2>
 <div class="animal-block">
   <img src="pig.jpg" />
   <canvas id="pigChart" width="350"></canvas>
 </div>
 <h3>Analysis</h3>
 <p>Despite being a normal pig, 12 participants incorrectly believed it was cloned. This suggests cloning misconceptions arise when features look "unnatural," even in normal animals.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
 <h2>Sheep — Normal or Cloned?</h2>
 <div class="animal-block">
   <img src="sheep.jpg" />
   <canvas id="sheepChart" width="350"></canvas>
 </div>
 <h3>Analysis</h3>
 <p>The sheep was cloned, yet a minority believed it was normal (6 normal, 26 cloned). This shows participants were more accurate — cloning traits seemed more visually identifiable.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
 <h2>Gaur — Normal or Cloned?</h2>
 <div class="animal-block">
   <img src="naur.jpg" />
   <canvas id="gaurChart" width="350"></canvas>
 </div>
 <h3>Analysis</h3>
 <p>The cloned gaur was correctly identified by most participants (8 normal, 24 cloned). Sharp and unusual traits likely contributed to correct identification.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
 <h2>Dog — Normal or Cloned?</h2>
 <div class="animal-block">
   <img src="dog.jpg" />
   <canvas id="dogChart" width="350"></canvas>
 </div>
 <h3>Analysis</h3>
 <p>The dog was normal, yet 4 participants believed it was cloned. This small misidentification rate shows dogs are generally perceived as appearing “natural.”</p>
</div>

<!-- Combined Animal Results with Carousel -->
<div class="section">
 <h2>Overall Accuracy — All Four Animals</h2>

 <div id="animalCarousel" class="splide" style="margin-bottom:20px;">
   <div class="splide__track">
     <ul class="splide__list">
       <li class="splide__slide"><img src="pig.jpg"></li>
       <li class="splide__slide"><img src="sheep.jpg"></li>
       <li class="splide__slide"><img src="naur.jpg"></li>
       <li class="splide__slide"><img src="dog.jpg"></li>
     </ul>
   </div>
 </div>

 <canvas id="combinedChart"></canvas>

 <h3>Analysis</h3>
 <p>Summing all four animals: Normal identified 62 times, Cloned 66 times. Accuracy was highest on cloned animals, meaning participants were more confident identifying cloning markers than natural traits. The nearly even distribution highlights strong uncertainty overall.</p>
</div>

<!-- Human Cloning Question -->
<div class="section">
 <h2>Should Cloning Research Be Expanded to Humans?</h2>
 <canvas id="humanChart"></canvas>
 <h3>Analysis</h3>
 <p>With 12 supporting and 20 opposing, most participants do not support expanding cloning to humans. Ethical, religious, and identity concerns likely play a role.</p>
</div>

<!-- Final Summary -->
<div class="section">
 <h2>Overall Analysis</h2>
 <p>The survey results show that participants are generally open-minded about cloning animals but cautious about human cloning. Misidentification patterns indicate strong misconceptions about how cloned animals "should" look. People were more accurate at spotting cloned animals than normal ones, suggesting cloning has stereotypical traits in people’s minds. Overall, the research demonstrates that cloning remains a complex and misunderstood topic, and more education is needed to improve public understanding.</p>
