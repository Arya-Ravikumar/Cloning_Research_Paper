<!-- ====== SURVEY DESCRIPTION ====== -->
<div class="section">
    <h2>Survey Methodology</h2>
    <p>
        This research study was conducted to understand public perception regarding the cloning of animals and humans.
        Participants were randomly selected from various high-school grade levels and presented with a digital survey.
        The survey consisted of multiple-choice opinion questions and four image-based classification questions. Each
        participant was shown four animals—pig, sheep, gaur (naur), and dog—and asked to identify whether each one was a
        cloned or naturally born organism. The pig and dog images depicted normal (non-cloned) animals, while the sheep
        and gaur images depicted cloned specimens. No participant was informed beforehand which animals were cloned.
        The goal was to measure intuition, moral reasoning, and accuracy regarding cloned organisms.
        Data was collected anonymously to avoid bias.
    </p>
</div>

<!-- ====== QUESTION 1 — Should Animals Be Cloned? ====== -->
<div class="section">
    <h2>Should Animals Be Cloned?</h2>
    <canvas id="q1Chart"></canvas>

    <h3>Analysis</h3>
    <p>
        A total of 32 participants responded to this question. The distribution shows a fairly mixed response, with 12 in
        favor, 7 opposed, 9 undecided (“maybe”), and 4 unopposed/neutral. This suggests that while support exists, there
        is significant uncertainty among participants, likely due to ethical, biological, and environmental concerns.
    </p>
</div>

<!-- ====== QUESTION 2 — Is Cloning Animals Humane? ====== -->
<div class="section">
    <h2>Is Cloning Animals Humane?</h2>
    <canvas id="q2Chart"></canvas>
    <h3>Analysis</h3>
    <p>
        The majority (21 of 32) believe cloning can be humane under certain conditions. However, 11 participants feel it
        is not humane. This reflects the complex interplay between scientific benefit and perceived suffering or ethical
        dilemmas experienced by cloned organisms.
    </p>
</div>

<!-- ====== INDIVIDUAL ANIMAL CLASSIFICATION ====== -->

<div class="section">
    <h2>PIG — Normal Animal</h2>
    <div class="chart-block">
        <img src="pig.jpg" class="animal-img" />
        <canvas id="pigChart"></canvas>
    </div>
    <h3>Analysis</h3>
    <p>
        With 20 identifying it as normal and 12 incorrectly labeling it cloned, participants demonstrated partial
        accuracy. This suggests that physical appearance alone is not a reliable indicator for public identification.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>SHEEP — Cloned Animal</h2>
    <div class="chart-block">
        <img src="sheep.jpg" class="animal-img" />
        <canvas id="sheepChart"></canvas>
    </div>
    <h3>Analysis</h3>
    <p>
        Participants correctly identified the cloned sheep at a high rate (26 vs. 6). This may be due to unconscious
        association with Dolly the Sheep, the most famous cloned organism in history.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>GAUR / NAUR — Cloned Animal</h2>
    <div class="chart-block">
        <img src="naur.jpg" class="animal-img" />
        <canvas id="naurChart"></canvas>
    </div>
    <h3>Analysis</h3>
    <p>
        With 24 identifying the gaur as cloned, recognition was strong. Participants may have used subtle morphological
        cues or simply uncertainty about exotic species to assume cloning likelihood.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>DOG — Normal Animal</h2>
    <div class="chart-block">
        <img src="dog.jpg" class="animal-img" />
        <canvas id="dogChart"></canvas>
    </div>
    <h3>Analysis</h3>
    <p>
        Most participants (28 of 32) correctly identified the dog as normal. This likely stems from greater familiarity
        with dogs and recognition of typical canine traits.
    </p>
</div>

<!-- ====== TOTAL ANIMALS COMBINED GRAPH + CAROUSEL ====== -->
<div class="section">
    <h2>Total Accuracy Across All Four Animals</h2>
    <div class="carousel" id="animalCarousel">
        <div class="carousel-track" id="carouselTrack">
            <div class="carousel-slide"><img src="pig.jpg" class="animal-img"></div>
            <div class="carousel-slide"><img src="sheep.jpg" class="animal-img"></div>
            <div class="carousel-slide"><img src="naur.jpg" class="animal-img"></div>

        <button onclick="prevSlide()">◀</button>
        <button onclick="nextSlide()">▶</button>
    </div>
    <canvas id="totalChart"></canvas>
    <h3>Overall Analysis</h3>
    <p>
        Participants displayed strong recognition for familiar animals (dog, pig) and moderate to high recognition for
        cloned animals (sheep, gaur). Overall accuracy was above 65%, indicating that while appearance alone is not a
        perfect indicator, people may rely on intuition based on familiarity or assumptions about cloning.
    </p>
</div>

<!-- ====== HUMAN CLONING QUESTION ====== -->
<div class="section">
    <h2>Should We Expand Cloning Research to Humans?</h2>
    <canvas id="humanChart"></canvas>
    <h3>Analysis</h3>
    <p>
        With 12 in favor and 20 against, respondents overwhelmingly reject human cloning research. Ethical, biological,
        and societal concerns appear to dominate perceptions of risk.

    "You gotta consider reasons why the cloning is done. like if its to save an endangered species, then sure. but if its to help the market, then its wrong to clone them just to kill them off. depending on the intent and the policies/regulations that are set in place, its morality can be debated. the purpose also matters for humans, along with who gets to decide regulations, rights to do so, etc. (in the assumption that it would be safe in the first place)",
    "Cloning for parts is inhumane because then the clone-which is also a living organism-is not given a fair chance to live compared to naturally birthed organisms. But for restoration causes, cloning can be a valuable tool in my opinion.",
    "Not necessarily animals unless they can’t feel then we can have mindless animals that killing would be more morally justifiable",
    "It’s not ethical to clone animals if it is hurting them in any way shape or form, but the main reason people clone is because they want to use parts from the clone which is immoral.",
